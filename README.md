## Project Goals

Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are one of the most powerful forces of nature on Earth. Due to climate change caused by human activity, the number and intensity of hurricanes has risen, calling for better preparation by the many communities that are devastated by them. We will have to look at data about the most powerful hurricanes that have occurred.

I will work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

Thank you for visiting my repository 😃👏
