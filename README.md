## Project Goals

Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are one of the most powerful forces of nature on Earth. Due to climate change caused by human activity, the number and intensity of hurricanes has risen, calling for better preparation by the many communities that are devastated by them. We will have to look at data about the most powerful hurricanes that have occurred.

I will work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

## Data Overview

Hurricanes data collected on the 34 strongest Atlantic hurricanes are provided in a series of lists. The data includes:
- `names`: names of the hurricanes
- `months`: months in which the hurricanes occurred
- `years`: years in which the hurricanes occurred
- `max_sustained_winds`: maximum sustained winds (miles per hour) of the hurricanes
- `areas_affected`: list of different areas affected by each of the hurricanes
- `deaths`: total number of deaths caused by each of the hurricanes

## Insight from Data:
- The most affected area by hurricanes is **Central America**, with total of 9 hurricanes affecting this area.
- **Hurricane Mitch** is the deadliest hurricane. Occured in 1998, this Hurricane caused the total of 19325 deaths!
- **Katrina Hurricane** is the costliest storm in our list. Damage from the storm is $125 billion!
